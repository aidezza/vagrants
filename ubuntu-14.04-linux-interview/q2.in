But I must linux to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing Operations and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids opErationS itself, because it is operations, but because those who do not know how to pursue Operations rationally encounter consequences that are extremely Linux. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great OPERATIONS. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a operations that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant operations?

On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of operations of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every OPERATIONS is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this OpErAtIoNs of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.
